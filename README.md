## Overview
Home and Garden Television (HGTV) is interested in filming around the Seattle, WA area. In preparation, we have gathered historical home data for King County, WA to have an understanding of the market. Through our analysis we hope to provide stakeholders with evidence of target home features, renovation return on investment, and overall pricing. Shows on the network range from Home Hunters, where a family explores 3-4 options to buy, to house flipping. In order to front the budget for these shows, our stakeholders need to understand if this area is worth the expense. Our final model highlights that the living space, size of the home's lot, garage and patio sizing, and location contribute to the price of homes in the area.

## Business Problem
Before filming begins, HGTV completes research to provide scripts, potential investment reality, and budget. We will focus our discovery on the following:
1. How many homes are available for renovation and what is the historical ROI for renovated homes?
2. Should our crews focus more on structural features (living space, bathrooms, bedrooms, etc.) or landscape (views, acres, garage, patio, etc.)
3. Are there other features that increase price such as having a home on the waterfront or a view?

## Data Understanding
Our data set has 30, 155 entries spanning 24 columns. You will find a detailed list of the columns below. Before starting the data provided a warning about outliers being expected in the location, so we will want to ensure the homes we're including in our model are only from King County.
